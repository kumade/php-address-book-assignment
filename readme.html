    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Add a person to the address book.</h3>
            <p>
                Call <code>$addressBook->addPerson</code> and pass a person as a parameter. Sample usage: see <code>AddressBookTest::testAddPerson</code>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add a group to the address book.</h3>
            <p>
                Call <code>$addressBook->addGroup</code> and pass a group as a parameter. Sample usage: see <code>AddressBookTest::testAddGroup</code>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Given a group we want to easily find its members.</h3>
            <p>
                First add desired persons and groups to an address book with previous methods. Then add desired persons to a specific group with <code>$someGroup->addPerson</code> and pass a person as a parameter. 
                Then call <code>$addressBook->findGroupMembers</code> and pass the group as a parameter. Sample usage: see <code>AddressBookTest::testFindGroupMembers</code>.
                Method returns an array of Person objects.

        <li>
            <h3>Given a person we want to easily find the groups the person belongs to.</h3>
            <p>
                First add desired persons and groups to an address book with previous methods. Then add desired person to a few groups with <code>$someGroup->addPerson</code> and pass a person as a parameter. 
                Then call <code>$addressBook->findPersonGroups</code> and pass the person as a parameter. Sample usage: see <code>AddressBookTest::testFindPersonGroups</code>.
                Method returns an array of Group objects.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h3>Find person by name (can supply either first name, last name, or both).</h3>
            <p>
                First add desired persons to an address book with previous methods.
                Then call <code>$addressBook->findPersonByName</code> and pass either first name, last name, or both as parameter(s). Sample usage: see <code>AddressBookTest::testFindPersonByName</code>.
                Method returns an array of Person objects, which match the condition.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Find person by email address (can supply either the exact string or a prefix string, ie. both "alexander@company.com" and "alex" should work).</h3>
            <p>
                First add desired persons to an address book with previous methods.
                Then call <code>$addressBook->findPersonByEmail</code> and pass either the exact string or a prefix string as a parameter. Sample usage: see <code>AddressBookTest::testFindPersonByEmail</code>.
                Method returns an array of Person objects, which match the condition.
            </p>

    <h1>Design-only question</h1>

    <h3>Find person by email address (can supply any substring, ie. "comp" should work assuming "alexander@company.com" is an email address in the address book) - discuss how you would implement this without coding the solution.</h3>

    <p>
        To achieve this you need to change a method <code>AddressBook::findPersonByEmail</code> in a way that it should search for a string, provided as a parameter, not only in the beginning of an email address, but throughout the entire email string.
        So, the filtering condition at line 74 have to be changed from <code>stripos($userEmail, $email) === 0</code> to <code>stripos($userEmail, $email) !== false</code>
